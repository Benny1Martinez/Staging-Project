### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Benny1Martinez/Benny1Martinez** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
I'm refresshing my coding skills and researching for a Capstone project for Divergence bootcamp.  I'm learning Python, PowerBI, SQL, Azure, R, Github, and more in order to present clear information that might provide insight into my capabilities as a Data Scientist.

My pronouns are They/El/Ella.

I am daring so I'll learn the things worth the experience and payoff.

Thanks for reading my readme.md.
Benny Adrian
